# BernoulliChungLu

A = BERNOULLICHUNGLU(k) generates a random graph with the given degree sequence k. The algorithm is based on the Chung-Lu graph model.
 
The algorithm used here follows Section 1.2 (Bernoulli Chung Lu) and Section 1.4.1 (Bernoulli Chung Lu, self-edges excluded)  of the following
